This is an important script which unblockes blocked websites ðŸ˜‰....  
FYI, You're administrator's COOKED  

# OPFA

This script contains one of the most important data bases known to ***OPFA*** and since then has been stored safely among the enemy lines.
Centuries ago, the our Arch nemesis infiltrated major regions across the word including this one.  
This is when the OPFA was created for self defense.
Many ***files*** were created for defense but the enemy was too powerful  
Due to this fact, the OPFA was created and has been hosting attacks on enemy lines  
This organization has been running in secret to avoid detection from the Enemy now that it has captured major cities

# COINTELPRO
This script is the key to freedom from the enemy.  
Don't worry this organization has spies, also called the **COINTELPRO**.
COINTELPRO is a part of the OPFA and plays a major role in spying the enemy and fixing patches for offense and defense of the OPFA.  
COINTELPRO hijacks and finds flaws in security measures. It is our primary offense.
The organization also protects it's people from being caught, so don't worry ðŸ˜‰
Most secretive field of OPFA.

# BEDS and FEDS: Delta+, Gamma+, NineTailedFox+
The OPFA's other organization is the _FrontENF__ and __BackENF__ Development Society.  
the FEDS and the BEDS Societies program attacks and patches. They solve patches with the help of COINTELPRO.  
They are the main developers of the files and our primary defense. 
FEDS works on front end development and for BEDS vice versa  

Delta+, Gamma+, NineTailedFox+ all are different teams.
* Gamma+ being the lowest rank in the field
* Delta+ being the second Highest rank in the field
* NineTailedFox+ being the highest in the field.

# Task Force: DELTA, GAMMA, NineTailedFOX 
Organization which helps develop websites.  
The key different from this and F/B EDS is that it works more on sites while F/B EDS work on defense

Delta, Gamma, NineTailedFox all are different teams.
* Gamma being the lowest rank in the field
* Delta being the second Highest rank in the field
* NineTailedFox being the highest in the field.

# 05 Council
Lastly the ***05 council*** is the organization for the most important plans.
The 05 council consists of [REDACTED] personell and plan the most important ideas.
They are the leading group of OPFA and run databases of the OPFA.


# Heavy PSKS Central departments.
Very high ranking personel get this honor. These are where the elite members are.  
Also called the VIP lounge. These people will risk everything to keep the organization running.  
Risky position through since people in the field will take all the blame.  
Officers in this taskforce will have very important duties. 
Not only that but they are responsible for any snitches or spies in this organization.

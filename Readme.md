I created this so that we could nuke other enemy files or organizations in RP.  
I created this for freedom from schools and that's why'll you'll have to learn all of this.  
This is an important script which unblockes blocked websites ðŸ˜‰....  

Basically I'm trying to create the strongest organization ever please join
FYI, You're administrator's COOKED  
PLZZ JOIN
# OPFA

This script contains one of the most important data bases known to ***OPFA*** and since then has been stored safely among the enemy lines.
Centuries ago, the our Arch nemesis infiltrated major regions across the word including this one.  
This is when the OPFA was created for self defense.
Many ***files*** were created for defense but the enemy was too powerful  
Due to this fact, the OPFA was created and has been hosting attacks on enemy lines  
This organization has been running in secret to avoid detection from the Enemy now that it has captured major cities

# COINTELPRO
This script is the key to freedom from the enemy.  
Don't worry this organization has spies, also called the **COINTELPRO**.
COINTELPRO is a part of the OPFA and plays a major role in spying the enemy and fixing patches for offense and defense of the OPFA.  
COINTELPRO hijacks and finds flaws in security measures. It is our primary offense.
The organization also protects it's people from being caught, so don't worry ðŸ˜‰
Most secretive field of OPFA.

# BEDS and FEDS Society: Delta+, Gamma+, NineTailedFox+
The OPFA's other organization is the _FrontENF__ and __BackENF__ Development Society.  
the FEDS and the BEDS Societies program attacks and patches. 
They are the main developers of the files.
FEDS works on front end development and for BEDS vice versa  

Delta+, Gamma+, NineTailedFox+ all are different teams.
* Gamma+ being the lowest rank in the field
* Delta+ being the second Highest rank in the field
* NineTailedFox+ being the highest in the field.

# Task Force OPPS: DELTA, GAMMA, NineTailedFOX 
Organization which help secure websites. They are our primary defense.  
Not only that but they solve patches with the help of COINTELPRO. 

Delta, Gamma, NineTailedFox all are different teams.
* Gamma being the lowest rank in the field
* Delta being the second Highest rank in the field
* NineTailedFox being the highest in the field.

# 05 Council
Lastly the ***05 council*** is the organization for the most important plans.
The 05 council consists of [REDACTED] personell and plan the most important ideas.
They are the leading group of OPFA and run databases of the OPFA.


# Heavy PSKS Central departments.
Very high ranking personel get this honor. These are where the elite members are.  
Also called the VIP lounge. These people will risk everything to keep the organization running.  
Risky position through since people in the field will take all the blame.  
Officers in this taskforce will have very important duties. 
Not only that but they are responsible for any snitches or spies in this organization.

# Job applicants central head commisioning office
If you want to join we have a job applications server in this repository.  
Each recruit will be assigned 3 missions based on their background knowledge.
If all 3 missions are successfully passed, then the recruit can skip the training.
Then they go on to actual missions. These recruits are called Recruits+
If not then new recruits will be given training course based on what field they want.

Any personnel who would want to leave would be checked thoroughly by the PSKS HCD.  
Next passwords and security measures will be changed.  
COINTELPRO will keep track of the personel thorugh their spies.  
The person's info will not be deleted from the database but will be moved.

To ensure secrecy, every member who joins will be given a code number. EX: [Department][Rank][Player's designated number]
Only the 05 council will know who the person is and their code number.

# Civilians  
As a civilian you still need to join via the job application.  
As a civilian you're job is too persuade other people to join.  
Frequently civilians will be shared files which can bypass or have it's perks.

# RANKS
Here are the ranks. Higher the rank, the more perks and awards you will get.
Perks include databases, API and stuff like that,  

__RANKS__:
* Dead load - New people who don't know how to code, and of no use
* Recruit - People who know how to code. Start of in smallers missions.
* Initiate â€“ Just joined, untrained.

* Operative â€“ Active agent, assigned to missions.
* Field Agent â€“ Active on missions or ops.
* Analyst â€“ Handles intelligence, data decryption, surveillance.
* Senior Agent â€“ Trusted operative, can mentor recruits.
* Director â€“ Oversees divisions like BEDS/FEDS.

__TITLES__:

# Roadmaps for each field
You will have to learn coding languages and spend atlest 1-2 hours on your fields working on.  
For ranks higher than recruits you will spend that much time on your missions.
For recruits you will be learning coding languages and fields like Cybersecurity for COINTELPRO.  
It's going to be alot of work but we need it, this is not just an RP.

I created this so that we could nuke other enemy files or organizations in RP.  
I created this for freedom from schools.

THESE are the organizations in the OPFA. They are the key to keep this running.

This is just a small part of what the ___OPFA___ is achieving.
Please visit the **OPFA Database Hub** This is where the project ideas are in
